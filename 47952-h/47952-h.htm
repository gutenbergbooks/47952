<p class="drop-cap">THERE is no more beautiful bird
in our northern states, if there
be in the whole country, than
our waxwing. Many birds are
more gorgeously appareled, and with
many there are more striking contrasts
exhibited, but nowhere do we encounter
a texture more delicate covering a
bearing more courtly. One despairs of
adequately describing the silky softness
of the plumage and the beautiful
shades of color. But the perfecting of
color photography has made that task
unnecessary. We may wonder why
some crested birds have this regal insignia
bestowed upon them by nature,
but it would be impossible to think of
the waxwing without his crowning
glory. Not less characteristic are the
horny appendages resembling red sealing
wax attached to the secondary wing
feathers and sometimes also to the tail
feathers. They seem to be outgrowths
of the tip of the shaft. These, with the
yellow-tipped tail, form the only bright
colors in the plumage.</p>

<p>The cedar waxwings are gregarious,
except during the breeding-season, wandering
about the country in flocks of a
dozen individuals, more or less, stopping
for any considerable time only
where food is plentiful. Their wandering
propensities make their presence a
very uncertain quantity at any season
of the year. During the whole of 1898
they were present in considerable numbers
at Oberlin, Ohio, nesting in orchards
and shade trees plentifully, but
thus far in 1899 very few have been
seen. No doubt their presence is not
suspected even when they may be numerous,
because they do not herald
their appearance with a loud voice nor
with whistling wing. Their voice accords
perfectly with their attire, their
manners are quiet and unassuming, and
their flight is well-nigh noiseless. One
moment the flock is vaulting through
the air in short bounds, the next its
members are perched in a treetop with
erected crests at attention. If all is
quiet without cause for suspicion, the
flock begins feeding upon the insect
pests, if they are in season; upon the
fruit, if that is in season. So compact
is the flock, both in flight and while
resting, that nearly every member
might be taken at a single shot. The
birds are so unsuspicious that they can
easily be approached, thus presenting
a tempting prize to the small hunter
who may design the beautiful plumage
for some hat decoration.</p>

<p>In common with the goldfinch, the
waxwings are late breeders, making
their nests in June, July, and August.
They seem to prefer rather small trees
and low ones, nesting in orchard trees
and in ornamental shrubbery as well as
in shade trees. The nest is not usually
an elaborate affair, but rather loosely
made of twigs, grass, rootlets, and
leaves, often lined with grape-vine
bark, thus hinting that the species has
sprung from an original tropical stock,
which necessarily makes its nest as cool
and airy as practicable. The eggs are
unique among the smaller ones, in their
steely bluish-gray ground, rather evenly
overlaid with dots and scratches of
dark brown or black, thus presenting
an aggressiveness out of all harmony
with the birds. But the peculiar colors
and pattern aid greatly in rendering
the eggs inconspicuous in the nest, as
anyone may prove by noticing them as
they lie on their bed of rootlets or
leaves. They are usually four in number
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</a></span>
in this locality, but may vary somewhat
according to the season and individual
characteristics.</p>

<p>The food of the waxwing is varied
both according to season and other
conditions. Wild fruit, berries, and
seeds form much of their food during
the fall and winter months. Mr. A. W.
Butler states that, "in winter nothing
attracts them so much as the hack-berry
(<i>Celtis occidentalis</i>). Some years,
early in spring, they are found living
upon red buds." The investigations of
the food of this species by Professor F.
E. L. Beal prove that the greater share
of it consists of wild fruit or seeds with
a very small allowance of cultivated
fruits. Animal matter forms a relatively
small proportion of the food, but
this small proportion by no means indicates
the insect-feeding habits of the
birds. It might well be suspected that
so varied a diet would enable the birds
to accommodate themselves to almost
any conditions, largely feeding upon
the food which happens to be the
most abundant at the time. Thus, an
outbreak of any insect pest calls the
waxwings in large flocks which destroy
great numbers to the almost entire
exclusion of fruit as a diet for the
time. It cannot be denied that the
waxwings do sometimes destroy not a
little early fruit, calling down upon
them righteous indignation; but at
other times they more than make
amends for the mischief done.</p>

<p>Of the voice Mr. A. W. Butler says,
"They have a peculiar lisping note,
uttered in a monotone varying in pitch.
As they sit among the branches of an
early Richmond cherry tree in early
June, the note seems to be inhaled, and
reminds me of a small boy who, when
eating juicy fruit, makes a noise by inhalation
in endeavoring to prevent the
loss of the juice and then exclaims,
'How good!' As the birds start to
fly, each repeats the note three or four
times. These notes develop into a
song as the summer comes on; a lisping,
peculiar song that tells that the
flocks are resolving into pairs as the
duties of the season press upon them."
After the pairing season there is a
great show of affection between the
two birds, which often continues long
after the nesting season has closed.</p>

<p class="drop-cap">COFFEE is a native of Abyssinia,
being first used by the natives
of the district called Kaffa,
whence its name. It is still
found wild in parts of Africa.</p>

<p>It was introduced into Arabia in the
fifteenth century, and is so well suited
to that soil and climate that the Mocha
coffee has never been excelled. It
became so popular that in 1638 the
Mohammedan priests issued an edict
against it, as the faithful frequented
the coffee shops more than the mosques.</p>

<p>In 1638 the beverage was sold in Paris,
but did not win favor for a few years
until it was introduced to the aristocracy
by Soliman Aga, the Ambassador
of the Sublime Porte at the Court of
Louis XIV. Coffee sipping became
fashionable, and before the middle of
the seventeenth century was the mode
in all the capitals of Europe.</p>

<p>Cromwell ordered the closing of the
coffee shops of England, but its popularity
did not wane.</p>

<p>In 1699 coffee was planted in Batavia
and Java. In 1720 three coffee shrubs
were sent from the Jardin des Plantes in
France to the Island of Martinique.</p>

<p>The voyage was long, and water becoming
scarce two of the plants perished,
but Captain Declieux shared his
ration of water with the other plant,
and it lived to become the ancestor of
all the coffee groves in America.</p>

<p>On the coat of arms of Brazil which
adorns every flag of that country is a
branch of coffee, a fit emblem, as Brazil
produces three-fourths of the coffee
of the world. It was first planted there
in 1754, and the first cargo was shipped
to the United States in 1809.</p>

<p>It can be grown from seeds or from
slips. Shrubs begin bearing the second
or third year, and are profitable
for fifteen years, some trees continue
bearing for twenty-five years.</p>

<p>They are planted six or eight feet
apart, and not allowed to grow more
than twelve feet high; and are not
pruned, so that the limbs bend nearly
to the ground. The long slender drooping
branches bear dark green, glossy
leaves, directly opposite to each other.
Between these leaves bloom the flowers;
clusters of five or six white star-shaped
blossoms, each an inch in diameter.
These jessamine-like flowers
touch each other, forming a long snowy
spray bordered with green. Nothing
can exceed the beauty of a coffee
grove in bloom, and its fragrance
makes it a veritable Eden.</p>

<p>It is beautiful again when the berries
are ripe. They resemble a large cranberry,
each berry containing two grains,
the flat sides together. The fruit is
slightly sweet but not desirable. Three
crops are gathered in one year. I have
in memory a coffee plantation in the
mountains of Brazil, where the pickers
were African slaves. They made a
picturesque sight, picking into white
sacks swung in front of them, occasionally
emptying the fruit into broad, flat
baskets. Each man will pick more
than thirty pounds a day, and at sunset
they wind down the mountain paths
with their broad baskets of red berries
balanced on their heads.</p>

<p>The ripe fruit is put through a mill
which removes the pulp. The wet
berries are then spread to dry in the
sun on a floor of hardened earth, brick
or slate.</p>

<p>The coffee terrane in my memory
was about eighty feet square, laid with
smooth slate, and slightly sloping. It
had around it a moulding of plaster
with spaces of perforated zinc for the
escape of water. Orange and fig trees
dropped their fruit over its border and
it was an ideal spot for a moonlight
dance. The coffee house was near,
and an approaching cloud was a signal
to gather the coffee in.</p>

<p>When dry the grains are put through
a mill, or where primitive methods prevail,
pounded in a mortar to remove a
thin brittle shell which encloses each
grain. The coffee is then put into
sacks of five <i>arrobas</i>, or 160 pounds
each and carted to the warehouses of
the city.</p>

</div>
<p class="drop-cap">"WELL, I'm glad to get over to
this tree again out of the
sound of mother's voice. Duty
to my husband; that's all she
could talk about. All wives help to
build the home-nest," she says, "and
indeed do the most toward making it
snug and comfortable, and that I must
give up my old pastimes and pleasures
and settle down to housekeeping. Well,
if I must, I must, but oh! how I wish I
had never got married."</p>

<p>Not a word was exchanged between
the pair that night, and on the following
morning Mrs. B., with a disdainful
toss of her head, ironically announced
her willingness to become a hod-carrier,
a mason, or a carpenter, according
the desires of her lord.</p>

<p>They elected to build their nest in the
maple-tree, and you can imagine the
bickerings of the pair as the house progressed.
Mrs. B's. groans and bemoaning
over the effect, such "fetchings
and carryings" would have upon
her health, already delicate. How
often she was compelled from weakness
and fatigue to tuck her head under
her wing and rest, while Mr. B. carried
on the work tireless and uncomplaining.</p>

<p>"She may change when she has the
responsibility of a family," he mused,
"and perhaps become a helpmeet after
all. I must not be too severe with her,
so young and thoughtless and inexperienced."</p>

<p>So the nest at length was completed.</p>

<p>"My!" said a sharp-eyed old lady
bird, whose curiosity led her to take a
peep at the domicile one day while
Mrs. B. was off visiting with one of her
neighbors, "such an uncomfortable, ragged
looking nest; it is not even domed
as a nest should be when built in a tree.
And then the lining! If the babies escape
drowning in the first down-pour,
I am sure they'll be crippled for life, if
not hung outright, when they attempt
to leave the nest. You know how dangerous
it is when they get their feet entangled
in the rag ravelings and coils
of string, and if you'll believe me that
shiftless Jenny has just laid a lot of it
around the edges of the nest without
ever tucking it in. The way girls are
brought up now-a-days! Accomplishments
indeed! I think," with a sniff,
"if she had been taught something
about housekeeping instead of how to
arrange her feathers prettily, to dance
and sing, and fly in graceful circles it
would have been much better for poor
Mr. B. Poor fellow, how I do pity
him," and off the old lady flew to talk
it over with another neighbor.</p>

<p>Unlike some young wives of the sparrow
family, Mrs. B. did not sit on the
first almost spotless white egg which
she deposited in the nest, but waited
till four others, prettily spotted with
brown, and black, and lavender lay beside
it.</p>

<p>"Whine, whine from morning till
night!" cried her exasperated spouse
after brooding had begun. "Sitting
still so much, you say, doesn't agree
with you. Your beauty is departing!
You are growing thin and careworn!
The little outings you take are only
tantalizing. I am sure most wives
wouldn't consider it a hardship to sit
still and be fed with the delicious grubs
and dainty tidbits which I go to such
pains to fetch for you. That was a
particularly fine grub I brought you
this morning, and you ate it without
one word of thanks, or even a look of
gratitude. Nothing but complaints
and tears! It is enough to drive any
husband mad. I fly away in the morning
with a heavy heart, and when I see
and hear other sparrows hopping and
singing cheerfully about their nests, receiving
chirps of encouragement and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</a></span>
love from their sitting mates in return,
I feel as though&mdash;as though I would
rather die than be compelled to return
to my unhappy home again."</p>

<p>"Oh, you do?" sarcastically rejoined
Mrs. B. "That is of a piece with the
rest of your selfishness, Mr. Britisher,
I am sure. Die and leave me, the partner
of your bosom, to struggle through
the brooding season and afterward
bring up our large family the best I
may. Oh," breaking into tears, "I
wish I had never seen you, I really do."</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, that has been the burden
of your song for days, Mrs. B. I'm
sure I have no reason to bless the hour
I first laid eyes on you. Why, as the
saying goes, Mrs. B., you threw yourself
at my head at our very first meeting.
And your precious mamma! How
she did chirp about her darling Jenny's
accomplishments and sweet amiability.
Bah, what a ninny I was, to be sure!
Oh, you needn't shriek and pluck the
feathers from your head. Truth burns
sometimes, I know, and&mdash;oh you are
going to faint. Well faint!" and with
an exclamation more forcible than polite
Mr. B. flew away out of sight and
sound of his weeping spouse.</p>

<p>Wearily and sadly did Mrs. B. gaze
out of her humble home upon darkening
nature that evening. Many hours
had passed since the flight of Mr. B.,
and the promptings of hunger, if nothing
else, caused her to gaze about,
wistfully hoping for his return.
The calls of other birds to their mates
filled the air, and lent an additional
mournfulness to her lonely situation.</p>

<p>"How glad I shall be to see him,"
she thought, her heart warming toward
him in his absence. "I'll be cheerful
and pretend to be contented after this,
for I should be very miserable without
him. I have been very foolish, and
given him cause for all the harsh things
he has said, perhaps. Oh, I <i>do</i> wish
he would come."</p>

<p>Night came down, dark and lonely.
The voices and whirrings of her neighbors'
wings had long since given place
to stillness as one after another retired
for the night. The wind swayed the
branches of the tree in which she
nested, their groanings and the sharp
responses of the leaves filling the
watcher's mind with gloomy forebodings.</p>

<p>"I am so frightened," she murmured,
"there is surely going to be a storm.
Oh, I wish I had listened to Mr. B.
and not insisted upon building our
home in the crotch of this tree. He
said it was not wise, and that we would
be much safer and snugger under the
eaves or in a hole in the wall or tree.
But, no, I said, if I was compelled to
stay at home every day and sit upon
the nest it should be situated where I
could look out and see my neighbors
as they flew about. That was the reason
I was determined it should not be
domed. I wanted to see and be seen.
Oh, how foolish I have been! What
shall I do? What shall I do? I
am afraid to leave the nest even for a
minute for fear the eggs will get cold.
Mr. B. would never forgive me, then, I
am sure. But to stay out here in the
storm, all alone. Oh, I shall die, I
know I shall."</p>

<p>Morning broke with all nature, after
the rain, smiling and refreshed. Sleep
had not visited the eyelids of the forsaken
wife and with heavy eyes and
throbbing brain, she viewed the rising
dawn.</p>

<p>"Alas," she sighed, as the whirr of
wings and happy chirps of her neighbors
struck upon her ears, "how can
people be joyous when aching hearts
and lives broken with misery lie at
their very thresholds? The songs and
gleeful voices of my neighbors fill me
with anger and despair. I hate the
world and everybody in it. I am cold
and wet and hungry. I even hate the
sun that has risen to usher in a new
day.</p>

<p>"I must make an effort," she murmured
as the morning advanced and
Mr. B. did not return, "and get home
to mother. I am so weak I can
scarcely stand, much less fly. I am
burning with fever, and oh, how my
head throbs! Such trouble and sorrow
for one so young! I feel as though I
shall never smile again."</p>

<p>She steadied herself upon the edge
of the nest and, turning, gazed wistfully
and sadly upon the five tiny eggs,
which she now sorrowed to abandon.</p>

<p>"I may return," she sighed, "in time
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</a></span>
to lend them warmth, or may find my
dear mate performing that office in my
absence. I will pray that it may be so
as I fly. Praises would be mockery
from my throat to-day, mockery!"</p>

<hr class="small" />

<p>"Why, Jenny!" shrieked her mother
as Mrs. B. sank down exhausted upon
the threshold of her old home. "Whatever
<i>is</i> the matter with you, and what
has brought you here this time of
day?"</p>

<p>"I am hungry and sick, mother, and I
feel as though, as though&mdash;I am going
to die!"</p>

<p>"And where is Mr. Britisher? You've
no business to be hungry with a husband
to care for you," tartly replied
her mother, whilst bustling about to
find a grub or two to supply her daughter's
wants.</p>

<p>"I have no husband, I fear, mother.
He is&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Dead!" shrieked the old lady. "Don't
tell me Mr. Britisher is dead!"</p>

<p>"Dead, or worse," sadly replied her
daughter.</p>

<p>"Worse? Heaven defend us! You
don't mean he has deserted you?"</p>

<p>"He left me yesterday afternoon in
anger, and has not returned."</p>

<p>"Highty, tighty, that's it, is it?
Well, you have brought it all upon
yourself and will have to suffer for it.
I am sure your father talked enough
about idleness and vanity for you to
have heeded, and time and time again
I have told you that every husband in
the sparrow family is a bully and a
tyrant, and every wife, if she expects
to live happily, must let her mate have
his own way."</p>

<p>Mrs. B. sighed, and wearily dropped
her head upon her breast.</p>

<p>"You must go back," emphatically
said her mother, "before the neighborhood
gets wind of the affair. Mr.
Britisher may be home this very minute,
and glad enough he will be to see
you, I am sure. So go back, dear, before
the eggs grow cold and your
neighbors will be none the wiser."</p>

<p>"I am going, mother, but oh, I feel
so ill, so ill!" said the bereaved little
creature as she wearily poised for her
flight.</p>

<p>"She does look weakly and sick, poor
thing," said the mother with a sigh
watching her out of sight, "but
I don't believe in interfering between
husband and wife. Mr. Britisher,
indeed, gave me to understand
from the first that the less he saw of
his mother-in-law the better, remarking
that if that class would only stay
at home and manage their own household
affairs fewer couples, he thought,
would be parted. I considered that a
rather broad hint, and in consequence
have never visited them since they began
housekeeping. He has only gone
off in a huff, of course, and everything
will come out all right, I am sure."</p>

<p>Ere nightfall, however, motherly
anxiety impelled her to fly over to her
daughter's home.</p>

<p>Alas, only desolation and ruin were
there. At the foot of the tree lay the
form of Mrs. B. Exposure, sorrow,
and excitement had done their work.
It was a lifeless form which met her
tearful gaze.</p>

<p>The fate of Mr. Britisher was never
known. Rumor assigned his absence
to matrimonial infelicity, but his more
charitable neighbors, as they dropped
a tear to his memory, pictured his
mangled form a victim to the wanton
cruelty or mischievous sport of some
idle boy.</p>

<p>A gentleman passing by one day saw
the dismantled nest upon the ground
and carelessly stirred it with his cane.</p>

<p>"What is that, uncle?" queried a little
maid of some five summers who
walked by his side.</p>

<p>"That, little one," came the answer
slowly and impressively, "is an abandoned
home."</p>

<p>"An abandoned home," I repeated,
as his words floated up to my window.
"Aye, truly to the casual observer that
is all it seems, but, oh, how little do
they dream of the folly, the suffering,
the sad, almost tragic ending of the
wee feathered couple whom I saw build
that humble home."</p>

</div>
<p class="drop-cap">THE specimen of this animal presented
here (<i>Hyrax abyssinicus</i>)
is the best-known of the species.
It measures from ten to
twelve inches in length; the fur consists
of somewhat long, fine hairs, gray-brown
at the base, lighter gray in the
middle portions, merging into a dark-brown
surmounted by a light-colored
tip, the resulting general color of this
combination being a mottled pale-gray.</p>

<p>The Book of Proverbs, enumerating
four animals which it describes as "exceeding
wise," says: "The conies are
but a feeble folk, yet they make their
houses in the rocks." The conies are
mentioned by various writers as well-known
animals in days of remotest antiquity.
They are found in the wild,
desolate mountain regions of Africa
and western Asia, and the variety inhabiting
Syria and Palestine is probably
referred to in the Hebrew text
of the Bible under the name of "laphan,"
which Luther translated by the word,
"rabbit," and in the authorized and revised
versions is rendered "cony."
They inhabit all the mountains of
Syria, Palestine, and Arabia, perhaps
also of Persia, the Nile country, east,
west, and south Africa, frequently at
elevations of six thousand or nine thousand
feet above sea-level, and "the
peaks and cones that rise like islands
sheer above the surface of the plains&mdash;the
presence of the little animals constituting
one of the characteristic features
of the high table-lands of northeastern
Africa." It is stated that if
the observer quietly passes through the
valleys he sees them sitting or lying
in rows on the projecting ledges, as
they are a lazy, comfort-loving tribe
and like to bask in the warm sunshine.
A rapid movement or unusual
noise quickly stampedes them, and
they all flee with an agility like that
usual among rodents, and almost instantly
disappear. A traveler says of
them, that in the neighborhood
of villages, where they are also to be
found, they show little fear of the
natives, and boldly attend to their
affairs as if they understood that nobody
thinks of molesting them; but
when approached by people whose
color or attire differs from that of their
usual human neighbors, they at once
retreat to their holes in the rocks. A
dog inspires them with greater fear
than does a human being. When
startled by a canine foe, even after they
have become hidden, safe from pursuit,
in their rocky crevices, they continue
to give utterance to their curious, tremulous
yell, which resembles the cry of
small monkeys.</p>

<p>Brehm confirms the statement of another
traveler, who called attention to
the striking fact that the peaceable and
defenseless cony lives in the permanent
society and on the best of terms with a
by no means despicable beast of prey,
a variety of mongoose.</p>

<p>In regard to their movements and mental
characteristics, the conies have been
placed between the unwieldy rhinoceros
and the nimble rodent. They
are excellent climbers. The soles of
the feet are as elastic and springy as
rubber, enabling the animal to contract
and distend the middle cleft or fissure
of its sole-pad at will, and thereby to
secure a hold on a smooth surface by
means of suction. In behavior the
conies are gentle, simple, and timid.
The social instinct is highly developed
in them, and they are rarely seen alone.</p>

<p>The conies have been regarded as the
smallest and daintiest of all the existing
species of odd-toed animals. Naturalists,
however, have held widely
divergent opinions as to the classification
of the pretty cliff-dwellers. Pallas,
because of their habits and outward appearance,
called them rodents. Oken
thought them to be related to the
marsupials, or pouched animals. Cuvier
placed them in his order of "many-toed
animals," which classification has
also been disputed, and Huxley has
raised them to the dignity of representatives
of a distinct order. Who shall
decide where all pretend to know?</p>

<p class="drop-cap">COFFEE is the seed of a small
evergreen tree or shrub ranging
from 15 to 25 feet in height.
The branches are spreading or
even pendant with opposite short
petioled leaves, which are ovate,
smooth, leathery, and dark green.
The flowers are perfect, fragrant, occurring
in groups of from three to
seven in the axils of the leaves. The
corolla is white, the calyx green and
small. The ovary is green at first,
changing to yellowish, and finally to
deep red or purple at maturity. Each
ovary has two seeds, the so-called
coffee beans.</p>

<p>The coffee tree is a native of the
tropical parts of Africa, in Abyssinia
and the interior. The Arabians were
among the first to transport it to their
native country for the purposes of cultivation.
From Arabia it was soon
transplanted to other tropical countries.</p>

<p>The name coffee (<i>Kaffee</i>, Ger., <i>Cafféier</i>,
Fr.) was supposed to have been
derived from the Arabian word <i>Kahwah</i>
or <i>Cahuah</i>, which referred to the
drink made from the coffee beans as
well as to wines. It is now generally
believed that the word was derived
from Kaffa, a country of the Abyssinian
highlands where the plant grows
wild very abundantly.</p>

<p>From Kaffa the coffee plant found
its way into Persia about the year 875,
and still later into Turkey. According
to popular belief, the drink coffee was
the invention of the Sheik Omar in
1258. Others maintain that the drink
was not known until even a later
period. The mufti, Gemal Eddin of
Aden, made a trip to Persia in 1500,
where he learned the use of coffee as
a drink, and introduced it into his own
country for the special purpose of supplying
it to the dervishes to make
them more enduring in their prayers
and supplications. In 1511 coffee had
already become a popular drink in
Mecca. About this time Chair Beg,
the governor of Mecca, issued an edict
proclaiming coffee-drinking injurious
and making the use of coffee a crime
against the laws of the Koran. It was
prophesied that on the day of judgment
the faces of coffee drinkers would
be blacker than the pot in which the
coffee was made. As a result of this
crusade the coffee houses were closed;
the coffee plantations were destroyed,
and offenders were treated to the bastinade
or a reversed ride on a donkey.
The next governor of Mecca again
opened the coffee houses, and in 1534
Sultan Soliman opened the first coffee
houses in Constantinople, which were,
however, again closed by Sultan Murad
II., but not for long. In 1624 Venetian
merchants brought large quantities
of coffee into northern Italy. In
1632 there were 1,000 public coffee
houses in Cairo. In 1645 coffee-drinking
had already become very common
in southern Italy. A Greek named
Pasqua erected the first coffee house
in London (1652). Coffee houses appeared
in other cities in about the following
order: Marseilles, 1671; Paris,
1672; Vienna, 1683; Nürnberg and
Regensburg, 1686; Hamburg, 1687;
Stuttgart, 1712; Berlin, 1721. In 1674
the ladies of London petitioned the
government to suppress the coffee
houses. To discourage the use of
coffee it was maintained that the drink
was made from tar, soot, blood of Turks,
old shoes, old boots, etc.</p>

<p>These coffee houses were of great
significance, as may be gathered from
the rapidity with which they spread
and the general favor with which they
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</a></span>
were received. They were visited, not
so much on account of the drink that
was dispensed there, but rather for the
purpose of discussing political situations;
they constituted the favorite
meeting-places for anarchists, revolutionaries,
and high-class criminals. At
times it even became necessary to
close them entirely in order to check
or suppress political intrigues or plottings
against the government. At the
present time the saloons take the place
of coffee houses in most countries, and
many of them are still the hotbeds of
anarchy and crime. In Turkey, where
alcoholic drinks are prohibited, coffee
houses have full swing.</p>

<p>The Dutch again seemed to have
been the first to attempt the cultivation
of the coffee plant. In 1650 they
succeeded in transplanting a few trees
from Mecca to Batavia. From 1680 to
1690 the island already had large plantations;
others were soon started in
Ceylon, Surinam, and the Sunda islands.
About 1713 Captain Desclieux
carried some plants to the French
possessions of the West Indies (Martinique).
It is reported that only a
single plant reached its destination
alive, which is the ancestor of the coffee
trees of the enormous plantations
of the West Indies and South America.</p>

<p>The plant thrives best in a loamy
soil in an average annual temperature
of about 27 degrees C., with considerable
moisture and shade. Most plantations
are at an elevation of 1,000 feet to 2,500
above the sea-level. In order to insure
larger yields and to make gathering
easier the trees of the South American
plantations are clipped so as to keep
their height at about 6 feet to 6.5 feet.
The yield begins with the third year
and continues increasingly up to the
twentieth year. The fruit matures at
all seasons, and is gathered about three
times each year. In Arabia, where the
trees are usually not clipped, and hence
comparatively large, the fruit is knocked
off by means of sticks. In the West
Indies and South America the red, not
fully matured fruit is picked by hand.
The outer hard shell (fruit coat, pericarp)
is removed by pressure, rolling,
and shaking. The beans are now ready
for the market.</p>

<p>All of the different varieties or kinds
of coffee found upon the market are
from two species of <i>Coffea</i>; namely, <i>C.
Arabica</i> and <i>C. Liberica</i>; the latter
yielding the Liberian coffee, which is
of excellent quality.</p>

<p>There are a number of so-called coffees
which are used as substitutes for
true coffee, of which the following are
the more important. California coffee
is the somewhat coffee-like fruit of
<i>Rhamnus Californica</i>. Crust coffee is a
drink resembling coffee in color, made
from roasted bread crusts steeped in
water. Mogdad or Negro coffee is the
roasted seeds of <i>Cassia occidentalis</i>,
which are used as a substitute for coffee,
though they contain no caffeine.
Swedish coffee is the seeds of <i>Astragalus
Boeticus</i> used as coffee, for which
purpose it is cultivated in parts of Germany
and Hungary. Wild coffee is a
name given to several plants native in
India, as <i>Faramea odoratissima</i>, <i>Eugenia
disticha</i>, and <i>Casearia laetioides</i>. Kentucky
coffee is a large leguminous tree
(<i>Gymnocladus Canadensis</i>) of which the
seeds (coffee nut) are used as a substitute
for coffee.</p>

<p>The coffee beans are roasted before
they are in suitable condition for use.
At first the green beans were used.
According to one story, a shepherd
noticed that some of his sheep ate the
fruit of the coffee tree, and, as a result,
became very frisky. Presuming that
the coffee beans were the cause, he
also ate of the beans and noted an exhilarating
effect. The use of the
roasted beans was said to have originated
in Holland. Roasting should be
done carefully in a closed vessel in
order to retain as much of the aroma
as possible. This process modifies the
beans very much; they change from
green or greenish to brown and dark
brown and become brittle; they lose
about 15 to 30 per cent. of their weight,
at the same time increasing in size
from 30 to 50 per cent. The aroma is
almost wholly produced by the roasting
process, but if continued too long
or done at too high a temperature the
aroma is again lost. The temperature
should be uniform and the beans
should be stirred continually. It
should also be remembered that not
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</a></span>
all kinds or grades of coffee should be
roasted alike. In order to develop
the highest aroma, Mocha coffee
should be roasted until it becomes a
reddish yellow, and has lost 15 per
cent of its weight. Martinique coffee
should be roasted to a chestnut brown,
with a loss of 20 percent in weight;
Bourbon to a light bronze and a loss
in weight of 18 percent.</p>

<p>The various coffee drinks prepared
differ very widely in quality. This is
dependent upon the varying methods
employed in making them. The following
method is highly recommended.
It is advised to purchase a good quality
of the unroasted beans and proceed
as follows:</p>

<p>1. <i>Sorting Berries.</i>&mdash;Carefully remove
bad berries, dirt, husks, stones, and
other foreign matter usually present in
larger or smaller quantities.</p>

<p>2. <i>Roasting.</i>&mdash;Roast as indicated
above. Coat the hot beans with sugar
to retain the aromatic principles; cool
rapidly and keep in a dry place.</p>

<p>3. <i>Grinding.</i>&mdash;Grind fine just before
the coffee is to be made.</p>

<p>4. <i>Preparing the Coffee.</i>&mdash;Coffee is usually
made according to three methods;
by infiltration, by infusion, and by boiling.
Coffee by infiltration is made by
allowing boiling water to percolate
through the ground coffee. It is stated
that much of the aroma is lost by this
method. In the second process boiling
water is poured upon the ground
coffee and allowed to stand for some
time. This gives a highly aromatic but
comparatively weak coffee. In the
third process the coffee is boiled for
about five or ten minutes. This gives
a strong coffee, but much of the aroma
is lost. Since these methods do not
give an ideal coffee an eminent authority
recommends a fourth, as follows:
For three small cups of coffee take one
ounce of finely ground coffee. Place
three-fourths of this in the pot of boiling
water and boil for five or ten minutes;
then throw in the remaining one-fourth
and remove from the fire at once,
stirring for one minute. The first portion
of the coffee gives strength, the
second the flavor. It is not advisable
to filter the coffee as it is apt to modify
the aroma. Allow it to stand until
the grounds have settled.</p>

<p>Coffee is very frequently adulterated,
especially ground coffee. It is stated
that the beans have been adulterated
with artificial beans made of starch or of
clay. It is not uncommon to find pebbles
which have been added to increase
the weight. Most commonly the beans
are not carefully hulled and sorted so
that a considerable percentage of spoiled
beans and hulls are present. The coffee
plant seems to be quite susceptible
to the attacks of various pests. The
coffee blight is a microscopic fungus
(<i>Hemileia vastatrix</i>) very common in
Ceylon which has on several occasions
almost entirely destroyed the coffee
plantations. The coffee borer is the
larva of a coleopter (<i>Xylotrechus quadripes</i>)
which injures and destroys the trees
by boring into the wood. The pest is
most abundant in India, while another
borer (<i>Areocerus coffeæ</i>) is common in
South Africa. Another destructive
pest is the so-called coffee bug (<i>Lecanium
coffeæ</i>).</p>

<p>Ground coffee is adulterated with a
great variety of substances. The
roasted and ground roots of chicory
(<i>Cichorium intybus</i>), carrot (<i>Daucus carota</i>),
beet (<i>Beta vulgaris</i>), are very
much used. The rush nut (<i>Cyperus esculentus</i>),
and peanut are also used. A
large number of seeds are used for
adulterating purposes, as corn, barley,
oats, wheat, rye, and other cereals;
further, yellow flag, gray pea, milk
vetch, astragalus, hibiscus, holly, Spanish
broom, acorns, chestnuts, lupin, peas,
haricots, horse bean, sun flower, seeds of
gooseberry and grape. The seeds of
<i>Cassia occidentalis</i> known as "wild coffee"
are used as a substitute for coffee in
Dominica and are said to have a flavor
equal to that of true coffee. Sacca or
Sultan coffee consists of the husks of
the coffee berry, usually mixed with
coffee and said to improve its flavor.
In Sumatra an infusion is made of the
coffee leaves or the young twigs and
leaves. This is said to produce a refreshing
drink having the taste and
aroma of a mixture of coffee and tea.
Efforts have been made, especially in
England, to introduce leaf coffee with
but little success.</p>

<p>Coffee owes its stimulating properties
to an alkaloid caffeine which occurs
in the beans as well as in other parts of
the plant. Caffeine also occurs in other
plants; it is the active principle in Guarana
and is perhaps identical with theine,
the active principle of tea. It is generally
believed that moderate coffee-drinking
is beneficial rather than otherwise. It
has ever been the favorite drink of
those actively engaged in intellectual
work. It has been tested and found
satisfactory as a stimulant for soldiers
on long or forced marches. Injurious
effects are due to excessively strong
coffee, or a long-continued use of coffee
which has been standing for some
time and which contains considerable
tannin. Caffeine has been found very
useful in hemicrania and various nervous
affections. It has also been recommended
in dropsy due to heart lesion.
Strong, black coffee is very valuable
in counteracting poisoning by
opium and its derivatives. Coffee will
also check vomiting. Strong coffee is
apt to develop various nervous troubles,
as palpitation of the heart, sleeplessness,
indigestion, trembling. According
to one authority, it is the
aromatic principle of coffee which
causes sleeplessness.</p>

Champion for the English Sparrow."</a></p>

<p>I always rejoice when someone comes
forward in defense of the despised class,
finding them not wholly faulty. The
same hand created all, and surely each
must be of some use. I feel like saying
something in favor of the blue jay. I
am sure that all will acknowledge that
the jay has a handsome form and rare and
beautiful plumage, which at least makes
him "a thing of beauty;" he may not be "a
joy forever," but surely a delight to the
eye. Formerly my home was in northern
Iowa, living many years in one
place in a town of about 6,000 inhabitants.
Our lawn was spacious for a
town, filled with shrubbery and trees,
both evergreen and deciduous. We
did not encourage cats, usually keeping
dishes of water here and there for the
accommodation of the birds, and other
attractions which they seemed to appreciate,
as numerous migratory birds
came each season, taking up their abode
with us, to their evident enjoyment and
giving us much pleasure. The jays
were always with us, were petted and
as they became friendly and tame,
naturally we were much attached to
them. The limb of a tree growing very
close to a back veranda had been
sawed off and a board nailed on the
top forming a table, where we daily
laid crumbs and a number of jays as regularly
came after them. They were
fond of meat and almost anything from
the table. I found the jay to be a provident
bird; after satisfying his appetite
he safely buried the remainder of his
food. I often noticed them concealing
acorns and other nuts in hollow places
in the trees, and noticed also that they
were left till a stormy day which prevented
them from finding food elsewhere
as usual. I saw one bury a bit of
meat under leaves near a dead flower
twig; there came a rather deep fall of
snow that night, but the bird managed
to find it the next day with little difficulty
and flew off with a cry of delight.
The jay nested on the grounds, but that
did not seem to prevent other birds
from coming in great numbers and variety
and making their little homes
there also. I recall one year which was
but a repetition of most of the years.
The jays had a nest in a crab apple tree,
a cat bird nested in a vine close to the
house, a robin came familiarly to one of
the veranda pillars in front of the
house and built her solid nest of mud
and grass. A brown thrush took a
dense spruce for her nesting-place. A
blackbird, to my surprise, built a nest in
a fir tree. A grosbeak built a nest on a
swaying branch of a willow at the back
of the lot, and a bluebird occupied a
little house we had put in a walnut tree
for her convenience.</p>

<p>The orioles were always in evidence,
usually making their appearance in
early May when the fruit trees were in
bloom; first seen busily looking the
trees over for insects. Generally they
selected an outreaching branch of a
cottonwood tree, often near where they
could be watched from a veranda,
building their graceful nests and caring
for their little ones. The chattering
little wrens never questioned our friendliness,
but always built loose little nests
quite within our reach, either in a box
we provided for them or over the door;
at the same time others had their little
homes in cozy places in the barn, or in
the loose bark of an old tree. Each
bird attended to its own affairs without
perceptible molestation from others, as
a rule. It was evident, however, that
the jays were not tolerated in company
with other birds to any great extent,
and I fancy they had a rather bad reputation,
for I noticed the birds took a
defensive position often when a jay
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[Pg 212]</a></span>
made its appearance near their homes
without any apparent evil intent, that I
could discover. I would sometimes see
as many as five varieties of birds after
one jay; they were always victors, too.
The robin, I always observed, could defend
himself against a jay, never seemed
afraid to do so, and indeed seemed to
be the aggressor. The blue jay may be
a sly bird, a "robber and a thief,"
though I never detected those traits to
any especial extent; but he is handsome
and brightens the winter landscape.
To be sure, I found that he was
fond of green peas and corn and did
not hesitate in helping himself, also
sampling the bright Duchess apples.
The robin is equally fond of all small
fruits, and greedy as well.</p>

<p>The bluebirds came regularly in the
early spring for years, then ceased apparently
when the sparrows made their
appearance. The sparrows made many
attempts to usurp the little house provided
especially for the bluebird, but
were not allowed to do so and never
gained a footing on the premises; still
the little spring harbinger ever after
kept aloof from us. In the winter season
the English sparrow came occasionally
to share the bluejays' tidbits, but
was promptly repulsed, although other
birds came freely. The dainty little
snowbird, several kinds of woodpeckers,
now and then a chickadee, and
some other winter birds came also. I
had ways of enticing the birds to come
near where I could watch their habits
and peculiarities. All birds fear cats.
There are cats and cats&mdash;some never
molest birds or little chickens, but, as a
rule, they seem to be their natural enemies.
Little boys, I am sorry to say,
cause great destruction of birds, often
thoughtlessly, by trying their marksmanship.
I would banish every "sling
shot!" It is even worse than taking
eggs, for they are generally replaced;
but when the mother-bird is taken a
little brood is left helpless to suffer and
die. Thoughtful kindness towards little
birds should be encouraged among
children. I would have one day each
year devoted to the subject in all public
schools. It would bring birds under
the observation of many who otherwise
would pass them by unnoticed, and
when one takes an interest in anything,
be it flowers or birds, he or she is less
likely to cause their destruction.</p>

<p class="drop-cap">THE whole of North America is
the home of this pretty little
gull&mdash;from the Bermudas to
Labrador on the east, California
to the Yukon on the west, and from
the Gulf of Mexico at least to the Arctic
circle. This species is often common
near streams and other bodies of
water large enough to furnish their
food of fish. I have often seen flocks
of twenty or more birds passing over
central Iowa during the vernal migrations,
sometimes even stooping to
snatch some toothsome grub from the
freshly turned furrow, but oftener
sweeping past within easy range in
that lithe, graceful flight so characteristic
of this small gull. To the farm
boy, shut in away from any body of
water larger than an ice pond, where
no ocean birds could ever be expected
to wander, the appearance of this bird,
bearing the wild freedom of the ocean
in his every movement, is truly a
revelation. It sends the blood coursing
hotly through his veins until the
impulse to get away into the broader
activities of life cannot be put down.
I know not why it is, but some birds,
seen for the first time, seem to waft
the perfume of an unknown country to
us, well-nigh irresistibly calling us
away upon a new field of exploration
or endeavor.</p>

<p>The flight of Bonaparte's gull is
worthy of careful study. In common
with the other members of the group
of gulls, he progresses easily by continuous
leisurely wing beats, each
stroke of the wings seeming to throw
the light body slightly upward as
though it were not more than a feather's
weight. In the leisurely flight the
watchful eye is turned hither and
thither in quest of some food morsel,
which may be some luckless fish venturing
too near the surface of the
water, or possibly floating refuse. The
flight is sometimes so suddenly arrested
that the body of the bird seems
to be thrown backward before the
plunge is made, thus giving the impression
of a graceful litheness which
is not seen in the larger birds of this
group.</p>

<p>It is only in the breeding-plumage
that this species wears the slaty
plumbeous hood. In the winter the
hood is wanting, though it may be suggested
by a few dark spots, but there
is a dusky spot over the ears always.
It seems doubtful if the birds attain
the dark hood until the second or
third year, at which time they may be
said to be fully adult.</p>

<p>It was formerly supposed that this
gull nested entirely north of the United
States, but later investigations have
shown that it nests regularly in northern
Minnesota and even as far south
as the Saint Clair Flats near Detroit,
Mich. It may then be said to nest
from the northern United States northward
to the limit of its range. It is
rare along the Alaskan coast of Bering
Sea, and there seems to be no record
of it along the coast of the Arctic Ocean.</p>

<p>The nest is always placed in elevated
situations, in bushes, trees, or on high
stumps, and is composed of sticks,
grasses, and lined with softer vegetable
material. The eggs are three or
four in number and have the grayish-brown
to greenish-brown color, spotted
and blotched with browns, which is
characteristic of the gulls as a group.</p>

<p>While the gulls are fish-eaters and
almost constantly hover above the
fishers' nets, often catching over again
the fish which the nets have trapped,
we never hear of any warfare waged
against them by the fishermen. On
the contrary, the gulls are always on
the most friendly terms with them,
gladly accepting the fish found unworthy
of the market. But let a bird
of whatever kind visit the orchard or
chicken-yard, for whatever purpose,
and his life is not worth a moment's
consideration. We need again to sit
at the feet of fishermen as earnest inquirers.</p>

</div>
<p class="drop-cap">I AM glad the magazine of birds is
furnishing its readers so many
points about the good qualities of
our birds. And as they are being
protected more every year by the state
laws and by the lovers of birds, I think
they are sure to increase. I have often
been asked about the decrease in bird
life. The blame is generally put on
the taxidermist, collector, sportsman,
and schoolboy, which I claim is all
wrong. The taxidermist collector of
to-day is a lover of bird-life, and only
hunts specimens to mount for a scientific
purpose. This gives our school
children a better chance to study them.
The schoolboy and girl of to-day are
doing great good in the protection of
bird-life, and your book of birds has a
warm friend among them. The true
sportsman always lives up to the laws
and takes a fair chance with dog and
gun. The plume and bird collector
will soon be a thing of the past, as hats
trimmed with choice ribbons and jets are
fast taking the place of those covered
with feathers and birds. Now the persons
who hide behind all these, and
who destroy more bird-life in a single
season than all the hunters and collectors
of skins, are never brought to the
eyes of the press. These are the people
who have a fad for egg-collecting.
They not only rob the nest of its one
setting, but will take the eggs as long
as the bird will continue to lay, and, not
satisfied with that, will take the eggs
from every bird as long as they can find
them. They will even take the eggs
after incubation has begun, and often-times,
after a hard climb for the eggs,
will destroy the nest. There are thousands
upon thousands of settings of
eggs of every kind taken every year by
these fad egg collectors and you will
see in some of our magazines on ornithology
offers of from fifty to five hundred
settings for sale. Now, what is an
egg to this egg collector? Nothing.
But to the lover of birds there is a
great deal in that shell. There is a
life; the song of the woods and of the
home. In that shell is the true and
faithful worker who has saved our
farmers and our city homes and parks
from the plagues of insects that would
have destroyed crops and the beauty of
our homes. Shall the law allow these
nest-robbers to go on summer after
summer taking hundreds of thousands
of settings? If it shall I am afraid the
increase in our bird-life will be slow.
With the help of our game wardens
and sporting-clubs a great deal of this
could be stopped, and a great saving
could be made in game birds' eggs.
Our country school children can protect
our song birds' nests by driving
these collectors, with their climbing
irons and collecting cans, from their
farms in the breeding-season. Yes, it
often looks sad to see a song bird drop
at the report of the gun of the skin collector.
But when we think of the bird-egg
collector sneaking like a thief in the
night up a tree or through a hedge,
taking a setting of eggs on every side
while the frightened mother sits high
in the tree above, and then down and
off in search of more, only to come
back in a short time to take her eggs
again&mdash;what is bird-life to him? What
would he care to be sitting in the shade
by the lake or stream listening to the
song of the robin, or after a hard day's
work in the hot summer, be seated on
his porch to hear the evening song of
the warbler and the distant call of the
whippoorwill? Let the lovers of bird-life
commence with the spring song,
with the building of the nest, and save
each little life they can from the egg
collector. Will this man, if he may be
called a man, look into his long drawers
filled with eggs, and his extra settings
for sale and trade? Let him
think of the life he has taken, the
homes he has made unhappy. I should
think he would go like Macbeth from
his sleep to wash the blood from his
hands.</p>

<h2><a name="THE_BABOON" id="THE_BABOON"></a>THE BABOON.</h2>

<div>
  <img class="drop-cap" src="images/initial_n.jpg" width="56" height="70"
    alt="" />
</div>
<p class="drop-cap">NATURALISTS seem to be agreed
that the baboons (<i>cynocephalus</i>),
while one of the most remarkable
groups of the monkey family,
are the ugliest, rudest, coarsest, and
most repulsive representatives of it.
The animal stands in the lowest degree
of development of the monkey tribe,
and possesses none of the nobler shapes
and qualities of mind of other species.
Aristotle called the baboons dog-headed
monkeys, on account of the
shape of their heads, which have a resemblance
to that of a rude, fierce dog.</p>

<p>The baboons are found throughout
Africa, Arabia, and India. In the main
they are mountain monkeys, but also
live in forests and are excellent tree-climbers.
In the mountains they go as
high as nine thousand to thirteen thousand
feet above the sea-level, but give
preference to countries having an elevation
of three thousand or four thousand
feet. Old travelers assert that
mountainous regions are their true
home.</p>

<p>The food of the baboons consists
chiefly of onions, tubers, grass, fruit,
eggs, and insects of all kinds, but, as
they have also a greedy appetite for
animal food, they steal chickens and
kill small antelopes. In plantations,
and especially vineyards, they cause
the greatest damage, and are even said
to make their raids in an orderly, deliberate,
and nearly military manner.</p>

<p>Brehm, who observed them closely,
says that they resemble awkward dogs
in their gait, and even when they
do stand erect they like to lean on one
hand. When not hurried their walk is
slow and lumbering; as soon as they
are pursued, they fall into a singular
sort of gallop, which includes the most
peculiar movements of the body.</p>

<p>The moral traits of the baboons are
quite in accord with their external appearance.
Scheitlin describes them as
all more or less bad fellows, "always
savage, fierce, impudent, and malicious;
the muzzle is a coarse imitation of a
dog's, the face a distortion of a dog's
face. The look is cunning, the mind
wicked. They are more open to instruction
than the smaller monkeys and
have more common sense. Their imitative
nature seems such that they
barely escape being human. They
easily perceive traps and dangers, and
defend themselves with courage and
bravery. As bad as they may be, they
still are capable of being tamed in
youth, but when they become old their
gentle nature disappears, and they become
disobedient; they grin, scratch,
and bite. Education does not go deep
enough with them. It is said that in
the wild state they are more clever;
while in captivity they are gentler.
Their family name is 'dog-headed monkeys.'
If they only had the dog's soul
along with his head!" Another traveler
says that they have a few excellent
qualities; they are very fond of each
other and their children; they also become
attached to their keeper and
make themselves useful to him. "But
these good qualities are in no way sufficient
to counterbalance their bad habits
and passions. Cunning and malice
are common traits of all baboons, and
a blind rage is their chief characteristic.
A single word, a mocking smile, even
a cross look, will sometimes throw the
baboon into a rage, in which he loses
all self-control." Therefore the animal
is always dangerous and never to be
trifled with.</p>

<p>The baboons shun man. Their chief
enemy is the leopard, though it oftener
attacks the little ones, as the old fellows
are formidable in self-defense.
Scorpions they do not fear, as they
break off their poisonous tails with
great skill, and they are said to enjoy
eating these animals as much as they
do insects or spiders. They avoid poisonous
snakes with great caution.</p>

<p>This animal is said to be remarkable
for its ability in discovering water. In
South Africa, when the water begins to
run short, and the known fountains
have failed, it is deprived of water for
a whole day, until it is furious with
thirst. A long rope is then tied to its
collar, and it is suffered to run about
where it chooses. First it runs forward
a little, then stops, gets on its hind feet,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[Pg 218]</a></span>
and sniffs the air, especially noting
the wind and its direction. It will then,
perhaps, change its course, and after
running for some distance take another
observation. Presently it will spy out
a blade of grass, pluck it up, turn it on
all sides, smell it, and then go forward
again. Thus the animal proceeds until
it leads the party to water. In this respect
at least, baboons have their uses,
and on occasions have been the benefactors
of man.</p>

<p>The baboons have, in common with
the natives, a great fondness for a kind
of liquor manufactured from the grain of
the <i>durra</i> or <i>dohen</i>. They often become
intoxicated and thus become easy of
capture. They have been known to
drink wine, but could not be induced to
taste whisky. When they become
completely drunk they make the most
fearful faces, are boisterous and brutal,
and present altogether a degrading
caricature of some men.</p>

<p>As illustrating the characteristics of
fear and curiosity in the baboon, we
will quote the following from the personal
experience of Dr. Brehm, the
celebrated traveler. He had a great
many pets, among others a tame lioness,
who made the guenons rather nervous,
but did not strike terror to the hearts
of the courageous baboons. They used
to flee at her approach, but when she
really seemed to be about to attack one
of them, they stood their ground fairly
well. He often observed them as they
acted in this way. His baboons turned
to flee before the dogs, which he would
set upon them, but if a dog chanced to
grab a baboon, the latter would turn
round and courageously rout the
former. The monkey would bite,
scratch, and slap the dog's face so energetically
that the whipped brute
would take to his heels with a howl.
More ludicrous still seemed the terror
of the baboons of everything creeping,
and of frogs. The sight of an innocent
lizard or a harmless little frog would
bring them to despair, and they would
climb as high as their ropes would permit,
clinging to walls and posts in a
regular fit of fright. At the same time
their curiosity was such that they had
to take a closer look at the objects of
their alarm. Several times he brought
them poisonous snakes in tin boxes.
They knew perfectly well how dangerous
the inmates of these boxes were,
but could not resist the temptation of
opening them, and then seemed fairly
to revel in their own trepidation.</p>

</div>
<p class="drop-cap">JUST as the Audubon societies and
the appeals of humanitarians in
general have had some effect in
lessening the demand for the
aigrette for millinery purposes, and
their banishment, as officially announced,
from the helmets of the British
army, there springs up a new fashion
which, if generally adopted, will
prove very discouraging&mdash;especially to
the birds.</p>

<p>"She made a decided sensation last
evening at the opera," says Miss Vanity's
fond mamma. "Those blackbirds
with outspread wings at either side of
her head were simply fetching. They
drew every lorgnette and every eye in
the house upon her. Not a woman of
fashion, or otherwise, I venture to say,
will appear at a public function here-after
without a pair of stuffed birds in
her hair."</p>

<p>A melancholy outlook truly, though
as an onlooker expressed it, the effect
of the spreading wings was vastly more
grotesque than beautiful. The poor
little blackbirds! Their destruction
goes on without abatement.</p>

<p>"I like the hat," said a gentle-looking
little lady in a fashionable millinery
establishment the other day, "but,"
removing it from her head, "those
blackbirds must be removed and flowers
put in their place."</p>

<p>"A member of the Audubon Society,
probably," queried the attendant, respectfully.</p>

<p>"No," was the answer, "but for years
the birds have been welcome visitors at
our country place, great flocks of blackbirds,
especially, making their homes in
our trees. This year, and indeed the
last, but few appeared, and we have in
consequence no love for the hunters
and little respect for the women who,
for vanity's sake, make their slaughter
one of commercial necessity and greed."</p>

<p>'Tis said fashion is proof against the
appeals of common sense or morality,
and one must accept the statement as
true when, in spite of all that has been
said upon the subject, the Paris journals
announce that "birds are to be worn
more than ever and blouses made entirely
of feathers are coming into fashion."
The use of bird skins in Paris for
one week represent the destruction of
one million three hundred thousand
birds; in London the daily importation
ranges from three hundred to four hundred
thousand. It is honestly asserted
that, in the height of the season, fifty
thousand bird skins are received in
New York City daily.</p>

<p>At the annual meeting of the Audubon
Society of New York state a letter
was read from Governor Roosevelt in
which he said that he fully sympathized
with the purpose of the society and
that he could not understand how any
man or woman could fail to exert all
influence in support of its object.</p>

<p>"When I hear of the destruction of a
species," he added, "I feel just as if all
the works of some great writer had perished;
as if one had lost all instead of
only a part of Polybius or Livy."</p>

<p>Rev. Dr. Henry Van Dyke sent a
letter in which he said the sight of an
aigrette filled him with a feeling of indignation,
and that the skin of a dead
songbird stuck on the head of a tuneless
woman made him hate the barbarism
which lingers in our so-called civilization.
Mr. Frank M. Chapman, at
the same meeting, stated that the wide-spread
use of the quills of the brown
pelican for hat trimming was fast bringing
about the extinction of that species.</p>

<p class="drop-cap">NATURE loves silence and mystery.
Reticent, she keeps her own
counsel. Unlike man, she never
wears her heart upon her sleeve.
The clouds that wrap the mountain
about with mystery interpret nature's
tendency to veil her face and hold off
all intruders. By force and ingenuity
alone does man part the veil or pull
back the heavy curtains. The weight
of honors heaped upon him who deciphers
her secret writings on the rock
or turns some poison into balm and
medicine, or makes a copper thread to
be a bridge for speech, proclaims how
difficult it is to solve one of nature's
simplest secrets. For ages man shivered
with cold, but nature concealed the
anthracite under thick layers of soil.
For ages man burned with fever, but
nature secreted the balm under the
bark of the tree. For ages, unaided,
man bore his heavy burdens, yet nature
veiled the force of steam and concealed
the fact that both wind and river were
going man's way and might bear his
burdens.</p>

<p>Though centuries have passed, nature
is so reticent that man is still
uncertain whether a diet of grain
or a diet of flesh makes the ruddier
countenance. Also it is a matter of
doubt whether some young Lincoln can
best be educated in the university of
rail-splitting or in a modern college and
library; whether poverty or wealth does
the more to foster the poetic spirit of
Burns or the philosophic temper of
Bach. In the beautiful temple of Jerusalem
there was an outer wall, an inner
court, "a holy place," and afar-hidden
within, "a place most holy." Thus nature
conceals her secrets behind high
walls and doors, and God also hath
made thick the clouds that surround
the divine throne.</p>


<p class="ac p2">CONCEALMENTS OF NATURE.</p>

<p>Marvelous, indeed, the skill with
which nature conceals secrets numberless
and great in caskets small and mean.
She hides a habitable world in a swirling
fire-mist. A magician, she hides a
charter oak and acre-covering boughs
within an acorn's shell. She takes a lump
of mud to hold the outlines of a beauteous
vase. Beneath the flesh-bands
of a little babe she secretes the strength
of a giant, the wisdom of a sage and
seer. A glorious statue slumbers in
every block of marble; divine eloquence
sleeps in every pair of human lips; lustrous
beauty is for every brush and canvas;
unseen tools and forces are all
about inventors, but they who wrest
these secrets from nature must "work
like slaves, fight like gladiators, die like
martyrs."</p>

<p>For nature dwells behind adamantine
walls, and the inventor must capture
the fortress with naked fists. In the
physical realm burglars laugh at bolts
and bars behind which merchants hide
their gold and gems. Yet it took
Ptolemy and Newton 2,000 years to pick
the lock of the casket in which was
hidden the secret of the law of gravity.
Four centuries ago, skirting the edge
of this new continent, neither Columbus
nor Cabot knew what vast stretches
of valley, plain, and mountain lay beyond
the horizon.</p>

<p>If once a continent was the terra incognita,
now, under the microscope, a
drop of water takes on the dimensions
of a world, with horizons beyond which
man's intellect may not pass. Exploring
the raindrop with his magnifying-glass,
the scientist marvels at the myriad
beings moving through the watery
world. For the teardrop on the cheek
of the child, not less than the star riding
through God's sky, is surrounded
with mystery, and has its unexplored
remainder. Expecting openness from
nature, man finds clouds and concealment.
He hears a whisper where he
listens for the full thunder of God's
voice to roll along the horizon of time.</p>

<h2><a name="THE_OWLS_SANCTUARY" id="THE_OWLS_SANCTUARY"></a>THE OWLS' SANCTUARY.</h2>

<p class="ac">PROF. HENRY C. MERCER.</p>

<div>
  <img class="drop-cap" src="images/initial_s.jpg" width="60" height="70"

</div>
<p class="drop-cap">SEVEN bluish-white, almost spherical
eggs, resting on the plaster
floor of the court-house garret,
at Doylestown, Pennsylvania,
caught the eye of the janitor, Mr.
Bigell, as one day last August he had
entered the dark region by way of a
wooden wicket from the tower. Because
the court-house pigeons, whose
nestlings he then hunted, had made
the garret a breeding-place for years,
he fancied he had found another nest
of his domestic birds. But the eggs
were too large, and their excessive
number puzzled him, until some weeks
later, visiting the place again (probably
on the morning of September 20), he
found that all the eggs save one had
hatched into owlets, not pigeons.</p>

<p>The curious hissing creatures, two of
which seemed to have had a week's start
in growth, while one almost feather-less
appeared freshly hatched, sat huddled
together where the eggs had lain,
close against the north wall and by the
side of one of the cornice loop-holes
left by the architect for ventilating the
garret. Round about the young birds
were scattered a dozen or more carcasses
of mice (possibly a mole or
two), some of them freshly killed, and it
was this fact that first suggested to Mr.
Bigell the thought of the destruction
of his pigeons by the parent owls, who
had thus established themselves in the
midst of the latter's colony. But no
squab was ever missed from the neighboring
nests, and no sign of the death
of any of the other feathered tenants
of the garret at any time rewarded a
search.</p>

<p>As the janitor stood looking at the
nestlings for the first time, a very large
parent bird came in the loop-hole, fluttered
near him and went out, to return
and again fly away, leaving him to
wonder at the staring, brown-eyed,
monkey-faced creatures before him.
Mr. Bigell had thus found the rare nest
of the barn owl, <i>Strix pratincola</i>, a habitation
which Alexander Wilson, the
celebrated ornithologist, had never discovered,
and which had eluded the
search of the author of "Birds of
Pennsylvania." One of the most interesting
of American owls, and of all,
perhaps, the farmer's best friend, had
established its home and ventured to
rear its young, this time not in some
deserted barn of Nockamixon swamp,
or ancient hollow tree of Haycock
mountain, but in the garret of the most
public building of Doylestown, in the
midst of the county's capital itself.
When the janitor had left the place and
told the news to his friends, the dark
garret soon became a resort for the
curious, and two interesting facts in
connection with the coming of the
barn owls were manifest; first, that the
birds, which by nature nest in March,
were here nesting entirely out of season&mdash;strange
to say, about five months
behind time; from which it might be
inferred that the owls' previous nests
of the year had been destroyed, and
their love-making broken up in the
usual way; the way, for instance, illustrated
by the act of any one of a dozen
well remembered boys who, like the
writer, had "collected eggs;" by the
habitude of any one of a list of present
friends whose interest in animals
has not gone beyond the desire to possess
them in perpetual captivity and
watch their sad existence through the
bars of a cage; or by the "science" of
any one of several scientific colleagues
who, hunting specimens for the sake of
a show-case, "take" the female to investigate
its stomach.</p>

<p>Beyond the extraordinary nesting
date, it had been originally noticed
that the mother of the owlets was not
alone, four or five other barn owls having
first come to the court-house with
her. Driven by no one knew what fate,
the strange band had appeared to appeal,
as if in a body, to the
protection of man. They had placed
themselves at his mercy as a bobolink
when storm driven far from shore
lights upon a ship's mast.</p>

<p>But it seemed, in the case of the owls,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[Pg 224]</a></span>
no heart was touched. The human reception
was that which I have known
the snowy heron to receive, when, wandering
from its southern home, it
alights for awhile to cast its fair
shadow upon the mirror of the
Neshaminy, or such as that which, not
many years ago, met the unfortunate
deer which had escaped from a northern
park to seek refuge in Bucks
County woods. At first it trusted
humanity; at last it fled in terror from
the hue and cry of men in buggies and
on horseback, of enemies with dogs
and guns, who pursued it till strength
failed and its blood dyed the grass.</p>

<p>So the guns of humanity were
loaded for the owls. The birds were
too strange, too interesting, too wonderful
to live. The court house was
no sanctuary. Late one August night
one fell at a gun shot on the grass at
the poplar trees. Then another on
the pavement by the fountain. Another,
driven from its fellows, pursued
in mid air by two crows, perished of a
shot wound by the steps of a farm-house,
whose acres it could have rid of
field mice.</p>

<p>The word went out in Doylestown
that the owls were a nuisance. But we
visited them and studied their ways,
cries, and food, to find that they were
not a nuisance in their town sanctuary.</p>

<p>In twenty of the undigested pellets,
characteristic of owls, left by them
around the young birds, we found only
the remains, as identified by Mr. S. N.
Rhoads of the Academy of Natural
Sciences of Philadelphia, of the bones,
skulls, and hair of the field mouse
(<i>Microtus pennsylvanicus</i>) and star nose
mole (<i>Condylura cristata</i>). "They killed
the pigeons," said someone, speaking
without authority, after the manner of
a gossip who takes away the character
of a neighbor without proof. But they
had not killed the pigeons. About
twelve pairs of the latter, dwelling continually
with their squabs in the garret,
though they had not moved out of the
particular alcove appropriated by the
owls, had not been disturbed. What
better proof could be asked that <span class="sc">THE
BARN OWL IS NOT A POULTRY DESTROYER</span>?</p>

<p>It was objected that the owls' cries
kept citizens awake at night. But
when, one night last week, we heard
one of their low, rattling cries, scarcely
louder than the note of a katydid, and
learned that the janitor had never
heard the birds hoot, and that the purring
and hissing of the feeding birds in
the garret begins about sundown and
ceases in the course of an hour, we
could not believe that the sleep of any
citizen ever is or has been so disturbed.</p>

<p>When I saw the three little white
creatures yesterday in the court-house
garret, making their strange bows as
the candle light dazzled them, hissing
with a noise as of escaping steam, as
their brown eyes glowed, seemingly
through dark-rimmed, heart-shaped
masks, and as they bravely darted
towards me when I came too near, I
learned that one of the young had disappeared
and that but one of the
parent birds is left, the mother, who
will not desert her offspring.</p>

<p>On October 28 two young birds
were taken from their relatives to live
henceforth in captivity, and it may be
that two members of the same persecuted
band turned from the town and
flew away to build the much-talked-of
nest in a hollow apple tree at Mechanics'
Valley. If so, there again the
untaught boy, agent of the mother that
never thought, the Sunday school that
never taught, and the minister of the
Gospel that never spoke, was the relentless
enemy of the rare, beautiful,
and harmless birds. If he failed to
shoot the parents, he climbed the tree
and caught the young.</p>

<p>If the hostility to the owls of the
court house were to stop, if the caged
birds were to be put back with their
relatives, if the nocturnal gunners were
to relent, would the remaining birds
continue to add an interest to the
public buildings by remaining there
for the future as the guests of the
town? Would the citizens of Doylestown,
by degrees, become interested in
the pathetic fact of the birds' presence,
and grow proud of their remarkable
choice of sanctuary, as Dutch towns
are proud of their storks? To us, the
answer to these questions, with its hope
of enlightenment, seems to lie in the
hands of the mothers, of the teachers
of Sunday schools, and of the ministers.</p>

<p class="drop-cap">THE water thrush (<i>Seiurus noveboracensis</i>)
has so many popular
names that it will be recognized
by most observers by one or
more of them. It is called small-billed
water-thrush, water wagtail, water kick-up,
Besoy kick-up, and river pink
(<i>Jamaica</i>), aquatic accentor, and New
York aquatic thrush. It is found
chiefly east of the Mississippi River,
north to the Arctic coast, breeding
from the north border of the United
States northward. It winters in more
southern United States, all of middle
America, northern South America, and
all of West Indies. It is accidental in
Greenland. In Illinois this species is
known as a migrant, passing slowly
through in spring and fall, though in
the extreme southern portion a few
pass the winter, especially if the season
be mild. It frequents swampy woods
and open, wet places, nesting on the
ground or in the roots of overturned
trees at the borders of swamps. Mr.
M. K. Barnum of Syracuse, New York,
found a nest of this species in the roots
of a tree at the edge of a swamp on
the 30th of May. It was well concealed
by the overhanging roots, and
the cavity was nearly filled with moss,
leaves, and fine rootlets. The nest at
this date contained three young and
one egg. Two sets were taken, one
near Listowel, Ontario, from a nest under
a stump in a swamp, on June 7,
1888; the other from New Canada,
Nova Scotia, July 30, 1886. The nest
was built in moss on the side of a
fallen tree. The eggs are creamy-white,
speckled and spotted, most
heavily at the larger ends, with hazel
and lilac and cinnamon-rufous.</p>

<p>As a singer this little wagtail is not
easily matched, though as it is shy and
careful to keep as far from danger as
possible, the opportunity to hear it
sing is not often afforded one. Though
it makes its home near the water, it is
sometimes seen at a considerable distance
from it among the evergreen
trees.</p>

</div>
<p class="drop-cap">ALONG with Tagals, Ygorottes,
and other queer human beings
Uncle Sam has annexed in the
Philippine islands, says the
Chronicle, is the tarsier, an animal
which is now declared to be the grandfather
of man.</p>

<p>They say the tarsier is the ancestor of
the common monkey, which is the ancestor
of the anthropoid ape, which
some claim as the ancestor of man.</p>

<p>A real tarsier will soon make his appearance
at the national zoological
park. His arrival is awaited with intense
interest.</p>

<p>Monsieur Tarsier is a very gifted animal.
He derives his name from the
enormous development of the tarsus, or
ankle bones of his legs. His eyes are
enormous, so that he can see in the
dark. They even cause him to be
called a ghost. His fingers and toes
are provided with large pads, which
enable him to hold on to almost anything.</p>

<p>Professor Hubrecht of the University
of Utrecht has lately announced that
Monsieur Tarsier is no less a personage
than a "link" connecting Grandfather
Monkey with his ancestors. Thus the
scale of the evolution theorists would
be changed by Professor Hubrecht to
run: Man, ape, monkey, tarsier, and so
on, tarsier appearing as the great-grandfather
of mankind.</p>

<p>Tarsier may best be described as
having a face like an owl and a body,
limbs, and tail like those of a monkey.
His sitting height is about that of a
squirrel. As his enormous optics
would lead one to suppose, he cuts
capers in the night and sleeps in the
daytime, concealed usually in abandoned
clearings, where new growth has
sprung up to a height of twenty feet or
more. Very often he sleeps in a standing
posture, grasping the lower stem
of a small tree with his long and
slender fingers and toes. During his
nightly wanderings he utters a squeak
like that of a monkey. During the
day the pupils of his eyes contract to
fine lines, but after dark expand until
they fill most of the irises. From his
habit of feeding only upon insects he
has a strong, bat-like odor.</p>

<p>John Whitehead, who has spent the
last three years studying the animals
of the Philippines, foreshadows the
probable behavior of the tarsier when
he arrives at the national "zoo." The
Philippine natives call the little creature
"magou."</p>

<p>"In Samar," says Mr. Whitehead, in
a report just received at the Smithsonian,
"where at different times I
kept several tarsiers alive, I found
them very docile and easily managed
during the day. They feed freely off
grasshoppers, sitting on their haunches
on my hand. When offered an insect
the tarsier would stare for a short time
with its most wonderful eyes, then
slowly bend forward, and, with a
sudden dash, would seize the insect
with both hands and instantly carry it
to its mouth, shutting its eyes and
screwing up its tiny face in a most
whimsical fashion. The grasshopper
was then quickly passed through the
sharp little teeth, the kicking legs being
held with both hands.</p>

<p>"When the insect was beyond further
mischief the large eyes of the
tarsier would open and the legs and
wings were then bitten off, while the
rest of the body was thoroughly masticated.
My captive would also drink
fresh milk from a spoon. After the
sun had set this little animal became
most difficult to manage, escaping
when possible and making tremendous
jumps from chair to chair. When on
the floor it bounded about like a miniature
kangaroo, traveling about the
room on its hind legs with the tail
stretched out and curved upward, uttering
peculiar, shrill, monkeylike squeaks
and biting quite viciously when the opportunity
offered."</p>

<p class="drop-cap">THE great heath family (<i>Ericineæ</i>)
are scattered over many
parts of the world, and include a
great variety of plants, many like
the American laurel (<i>Kalmia</i>) being large
shrubs or small trees. Others are much
smaller, and among the smallest plants,
there is none more beautiful and universally
loved than the charming trailing
arbutus (<i>Epigæa repens</i>).</p>

<p>Those who are fortunate enough to
live in the localities where it is found
have the rare pleasure of searching for
the early blossoms, which prefer to nestle
cosily at the foot of the evergreen
trees, though they are sometimes found
in the open.</p>

<p>The late snows may even cover the
blooms, but when their delicate heads
are peering through, we know that
winter has fled, and that the snow mantle
is only a cast-off garment which, too,
will slip away, dissolved by the long
rays of the early spring sunshine.</p>

<p>In New England the trailing arbutus
is called May flower, and in other places
is known as the ground laurel. Its
scientific name (<i>Epigæa repens</i>) is from
two Greek words, <i>epigæa</i>, meaning
"upon the earth," and <i>repens</i>, "trailing,
or creeping."</p>

<p>The word arbutus is from the Latin,
meaning a tree, and is first applied to
another tribe of the same family, and
is pronounced with the accent on the
first syllable&mdash;<i>ar</i>butus. This must not be
confounded with the trailing arbutus,
where usage allows the accent on the
second syllable&mdash;ar<i>bu</i>tus (<i>Standard Dictionary</i>)
and whose characteristics are
very different.</p>

<p>The trailing arbutus is a native of the
eastern portion of North America, but
is found as far west as Wisconsin. It
grows among the rocks, or in a sandy
soil, as in Michigan, and it blossoms
from March until May, though April
is its chosen month.</p>

<p>The flowers are sometimes pure white
though usually beautifully tinged with
various shades of pink and red, and
though really forming terminal clusters,
they are apparently clustered in the
axils of the evergreen and leathery
leaves.</p>

<p>The leaves may be oval or orbicular,
and the stems which are tough and
hairy grow to the length of six to fifteen
inches.</p>

<p>The fragrance of the flower is very
strong and attractive, though its
strength varies with its locality and
with the character of the soil in which
it grows, and it is especially fine when
growing under evergreen trees.</p>

<p>The stamens of the flower are interesting
to the botanist as they vary
greatly, apparently to insure cross-fertilization.</p>

<p>A study of this species, as well as of
plant-life in general, teaches us that
nature abhors self-fertilization and, as a
rule, so develops plants that two individuals
of the same species are essential
to the production of seed.</p>

<p>This species especially enjoys nature,
and is not easily cultivated. A
few florists have succeeded in producing
mature plants with fair results, but
it may be stated that even transplanting,
with much soil attached to the
roots, to a soil identical with the native,
results in a weakened development.</p>

<p>The trailing arbutus is greatly loved
by the poet and writer, and has received
many tributes from gifted pens.</p>

<p>Donald G. Mitchell, in speaking of
the desolation of earliest spring, tells
us that "the faint blush of the arbutus,
in the midst of the bleak March atmosphere
will touch the heart like a
hope of heaven, in a field of graves."</p>

of <span class="sc">Birds and
All Nature</span> the common American
mole, which is the most common
species in the eastern portion
of the United States, is described, and
the habits of moles, which are identical,
were rather fully set forth. The hairy-tailed
mole (<i>Scapanus breweri</i>) is found
principally in the western part of the
United States.</p>

<p>This little animal has so many
enemies besides man, as polecats, owls,
ravens, storks, and the like, who watch
it as it throws up its hillocks, that it is
a wonder it has not been exterminated.
It betrays its home by its own handiwork,
as it is obliged constantly to construct
new hillocks in order to earn its
living. These hillocks always indicate
the direction and extent of its hunting-grounds.
The little weasels pursue it
in its conduits, where it also frequently
falls a prey to the adder. Only foxes,
weasels, hedgehogs, and the birds
already mentioned, eat it.</p>

<p>"Take the mole out of its proper
sphere," says Wood, "and it is awkward
and clumsy, but replace it in the familiar
earth, and it becomes a different
being&mdash;full of life and energy, and
actuated by a fiery activity which seems
quite inconsistent with its dull aspect
and seemingly inert form. The absence
of any external indication of eyes communicates
a peculiar dullness to the
creature's look, and the formation of
the fore-limbs gives an indescribable
awkwardness to its gait. In the ground
only is it happy, for there only can it
develop its various capabilities. No
one can witness the eagerness with
which it flings itself upon its prey, and
the evident enjoyment with which it
consumes its hapless victim without
perceiving that the creature is exultantly
happy in its own peculiar way.
His whole life is one of fury, and he
eats like a starving tiger, tearing and
rending his prey with claws and teeth.
A mole has been seen to fling itself
upon a small bird, tear its body open,
and devour it while still palpitating
with life. 'Nothing short of this fiery
energy could sustain an animal in the
life-long task of forcing itself through
the solid earth.'"</p>

<p>The hidden habitation of the mole
is described as a nearly spherical chamber,
the roof of which is nearly on a
level with the earth around the hill,
and therefore situated at a considerable
depth from the apex of the heap.
Around this are driven two circular
galleries&mdash;one just level with the ceiling,
and the other at some height above.
The upper circle is much smaller than
the lower. Five short, descending passages
connect the galleries with each
other, but the only entrance into the
inner apartment is from the upper gallery,
out of which three passages lead
into the ceiling. It will be seen, therefore,
that when a mole enters the
house from one of its tunnels, it has
first to get into the lower gallery, to
ascend thence to the upper gallery,
and so descend into its chamber. There
is another entrance from below, however,
by a passage which dips downward
from the center of the chamber,
and then, taking a curve upward, opens
into one of the larger tunnels.</p>

<p>The mole comes from the earth with
unsoiled fur, which is due in part to the
peculiar character of the hair, and
partly to strong membraneous muscles
beneath the skin, by means of which
the animal gives itself a frequent and
powerful shake.</p>

<p class="drop-cap">SUNLIGHT and moisture fall
upon the earth and find it full
of germs of life. At once
growths begin each after its
own kind. There is such a multitude
of them that they have not yet been
counted. Each locality has forms peculiar
to itself. The places most
abundantly watered have different
forms from those less favored by rain
and dew, and those receiving more
heat and sun allow more luxuriant
growths than others if the water supply
is large.</p>

<p>The business of life and growth is
mostly carried on by means of water
set in motion and sustained by heat.
Those forms of life which reach highest
above the surface of the earth are
called trees. They are always striving
to see what heights they can attain.
But the different forms of life have
limits set them which they cannot pass.
The structure of one tree is limited to
carrying its top twenty feet from the
ground, that of another is so favored
that it can reach twice that height, and
others tower high above us and stand
for centuries.</p>

<p>But the same tree does not flourish
with the same vigor in different places.
The nourishment of the soil may favor
it or poverty dwarf its growth. Moisture
and heat must be supplied or the
growth will be slight.</p>

<p>I have stood upon the thick tops of
cedar trees on high places in the White
mountains near the tree-line. Towards
the summit the trees diminish in size
until they become veritable dwarfs.
They are stunted by the cold. They
shrink aside or downward trying to
find shelter from the angry winds that
are so cutting. Diminutive tree trunks
are found that have curled themselves
into sheltering crannies of rock and
grown into such distorted shapes that
they are gathered as curiosities.</p>

<p>The last trees to give up the fight on
Mount Adams are the cedars of which
I speak. They hug the rock for the
little warmth that may be lurking
there in remembrance of the sun's
kindly rays; they mat themselves together
and interlock their branches so
as to form a springy covering to the
whole ground. One may lie down
upon their tops as upon a piece of upholstery,
and in the openings below are
rabbits and woodchucks and sometimes
bears safely hidden from the view of
the hunter.</p>

<p>From these ground-hugging trees of
the mountain-tops to the great redwoods
of our western slopes the mind
passes the entire range of tree life.
No trees are so great as our redwoods,
though in Australia the eucalyptus
reaches higher with a comparatively
slender trunk. Where the forests are
thickest, and the growth of the trees
consequently tallest, the eucalyptus
towers sometimes four or five hundred
feet towards the sky.</p>

<p>The shrinking of mountain trees
where the rock affords some warmth
and shelter is shown on a larger scale
in the forms of trees that stand at the
edge of a forest. Where a stream divides
the forest we find the trees upon
the bank reaching out their branches
and spreading luxuriant foliage over
the water, because the open air in that
direction helps the growth of leaves
and twigs. Shade trees by the road-side
reach out towards the open space
of the road and grow one-sided because
the conditions of light and air are better
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[Pg 234]</a></span>
over the road than against the buildings
or other trees that are behind them.</p>

<p>The prevailing winds of any country
bend the trees largely in one direction.
In the vicinity of Chicago, where the
return trade winds blow day after day
from the southwest, we find the willows
of the prairie all bending their heads
gracefully to the northeast.</p>

<p>The relations between trees and the
fertility of the country around them is
a matter of deep interest to man. Portions
of France have been productive
and afterwards barren because of the
abundance of the trees at first and their
having afterwards been cut down to
supply the wants of man, who desired
their material and the ground on which
they stood. The rivers of Michigan
are not navigable now in some instances
where once they were deep
with water. The destruction of the
forests to supply the lumber and furniture
markets of the world has caused
less rain to fall, and the snows of winter
which formerly lay late in spring
beneath the forests now melt at the return
of the sun in the early months and
are swept with the rush of high water
away to the great lakes. Many of the
barren wastes in Palestine and other
countries, which in olden times blossomed
as the rose, have lost their glory
with the destruction of their trees.</p>

<p>Men have learned something of the
value of the trees to a fertile country
and the science of forestry has arisen,
not only to determine the means of
growing beautiful and useful trees, but
also to court the winds of heaven to
drop their fatness upon the soil. In
the state of Nebraska 800,000,000
planted trees invite the rain and the
state is blessed by the response.</p>

<p>Man used to worship the forest. The
stillness and the solemn sounds of the
deep woods are uplifting to the soul
and healing to the mind. The great
gray trunks bearing heavenward their
wealth of foliage, the swaying of
branches in the breeze, the golden
shafts of sunlight that shoot down
through the noonday twilight, all tend
to rest the mind from the things of
human life and lift the thoughts to
things divine.</p>

<p>The highest form of architecture practiced
on earth is the Gothic, which holy
men devised from contemplation of
the lofty archings of trees and perpetuated
in the stone buildings erected to
God in western Europe through the
centuries clustering around the thirteenth.</p>

<p>Trees afford hiding and nesting
places for many birds and animals.
Their cooling shelter comforts the cattle;
they furnish coursing-places among
their branches for the sportive climbing-animals,
and their tender twigs give
restful delight to the little birds far out
of reach of any foe.</p>

<p>Man has always used the trees for
house building; his warmth is largely
supplied from fires of wood and leaves;
from the days when Adam and Eve did
their first tailoring with fig leaves, the
trees have been levied upon for articles
of clothing till now the world is supplied
with hats of wood, millions of
buttons of the same material are worn,
and the wooden shoes of the peasantry
of Europe clump gratefully over the
ground in acknowledgment of the debt
of mankind to the woods.</p>

<p>Weapons of all sorts, in all ages, have
been largely of wood. Houses, furniture,
troughs, spoons, bowls, plows, and
all sorts of implements for making a
living have been fashioned by man
from timber. Every sort of carriage
man ever devised, whether for land or
water travel, depended in its origin
upon the willing material the trees have
offered. Although we now have
learned to plow the seas with prow of
steel and ride the horseless carriage
that has little or no wood about it, yet
the very perfection of these has arisen
from the employment of wood in countless
experiments before the metal thing
was invented.</p>

<p>Our daily paper is printed from the
successors of Gutenberg's wooden type,
upon what seems to be paper, but is in
reality the ground-up and whitened
pulp of our forest trees. Our food is
largely of nuts and fruits presented
us by the trees of all climes, which are
yet brought to our doors in many instances
by wooden sailing-vessels,
whose sails are spread on spars from
our northern forests.</p>

<p>The baskets of the white man and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[Pg 235]</a></span>
the red Indian are made from the materials
of the forest. Ash strips are
pounded skillfully and readily separate
themselves in flat strips suitable
for weaving into receptacles for carrying
the berries of the forest shades or
the products of the soil, whose richness
came by reason of the long-standing
forests which stood above it and
fell into it for centuries.</p>

<p>Whoever has tried to stopper a
bottle when no cork was at hand knows
something of the value of one sort of
trees. He who has lain upon a bed of
fever without access to quinine knows
more of the debt we owe the generous
forests that invite us with their cooling
branches and their carpeted, mossy
floors. The uses of rubber to city people
are almost enough to induce one
to remove his hat in reverence to the
rubber tree; the esteem we have for
the products of the sugar maple and
the various products of the pine in
their common forms of tar, pitch, and
turpentine, as well as in their subtler
forms, which are so essential to the
arts and sciences, contributing to our
ease, comfort, and elegance, should
cause us to cherish the lofty pine and
the giant maple with warmest gratitude.</p>

<p>Perhaps the most refined of the
pleasures of man is found in the playing
of musical instruments. There is
not one of the sweeter-toned of all the
vast family of musical instruments that
is not dependent on the sympathetic
qualities of the various woods. The
violin shows the soul of this material
in its highest refinement. No other
instrument has so effectually caught
the tones of the glorious mountain and
the peaceful valley as has the choicely
selected and deftly fashioned shell of
the fiddle. It awakens all the fancies
of a lifetime in one short hour, it
brings gladness to the heart and enlivens
the whole frame, and when the
master hand brings out from its delicate
form the deeper secrets of its nature
the violin brings tears to our eyes
and inspires within us an earnestness
of purpose which is a perpetual tribute
of the soul of man to the heart of the
forest.</p>

<p>I took a spring journey once from
the heart of old Kentucky through
some of the northern states around to
the eastward to Virginia. The dogwood
was in blossom south of the
Ohio. The forests and hillsides were
set forth here and there in bridal array
by the glad whiteness of myriads of
these delicate flowers. Through Ohio
and Indiana the peach trees were putting
forth their delicate pink blossoms
that sought us out in the cars and delighted
us with their rare fragrance.
In Pennsylvania we passed out of the
peach region, and I thought the mountains
could not give flowers to match
the loveliness experienced on the two
preceding days, but when we were
running adown the "blue Juniata river"
there burst upon me the purple radiance
of the ironwood that I had entirely
forgotten as a flowering tree of
beauty. Brighter than the peach and
softer than the dogwood it stood out
against the foliage of the stream and hillside.
It followed the railway all down
the Susquehanna across the line into
Maryland, and gave me joy until it was
lost again as the warmth of the southern
sun poured itself again before my
eyes upon the purity and simplicity of
the snowy dogwood.</p>

<p>And in the fall I once passed through
the hills of New York and Massachusetts.
It was Thanksgiving Day. The
matchless American forests were then
in their greatest glory. Every hill
seemed to have brought out its choicest
holiday garment and was calling for
admiration. So richly blended are the
reds, the yellows, and the greens that
one cannot see how people can do
business with such delights for the eye
spread out before them. Why they do
not come en masse and join in this
holiday of the trees is more than I can
understand. It seems as if the Creator
of heaven and earth had reserved
for the home of liberty the most gorgeous
colorings that prismatic light is
susceptible of bearing, and thrown
them all down in luxurious profusion
for the delectation of the people who
should shake off the man-serving spirit
and come here to breathe the air of
freedom and rejoice with nature through
the ten days of her gorgeous Thanksgiving
time.</p>

<p class="ac">PROF. WILLIAM K. HIGLEY,<br  />

<div>
  <img class="drop-cap" src="images/initial_i.jpg" width="24" height="70"

</div>
<p class="drop-cap">IN THE early days of the Columbian
Exposition, before people had
ceased to wonder at the unexpected
and unusual sights, there
were beautiful displays of plants in
flower, on a scale never before attempted,
at least in this part of the
world.</p>

<p>Those wise enough to respond to
the invitation to visit the long, low
green houses in Jackson Park, before
the more pretentious Horticultural
Building was ready for use, will never
forget the royal mass of blossoms
which greeted their eyes as they passed
through long aisles of bloom.</p>

<p>The announcement that the cineraria
was on exhibition meant little to many,
but to those who found their way to the
park during the chilly spring days and
patiently trudged over unfinished paths,
and through rubbish and incompleteness,
the announcement opened the
door to a sight so wonderfully fine and
complete, so astonishing, and so delightful,
that to look was to exclaim
and admire, and to admire was to remember,
and, months after, to long for
another sight of that billowy mass of
pinky-purplish bloom.</p>

<p>The Compositæ, the family of plants
to which the cinerarias belong, contains
about seven hundred and sixty
genera and over ten thousand species,
embracing approximately one-tenth of
all the flowering forms. This is the
largest family of plants and includes
the goldenrod, the sunflower, the aster,
the chrysanthemum, the thistle, the
lettuce, the dandelion, and many others.
The species are widely distributed,
though more common in temperate or
hot regions, the largest number being
found in the Americas.</p>

<p>Though a family of herbs, there are a
few shrubs and in the tropics a small
number of trees. The cultivated forms
are numerous, and some are among our
most beautiful fall plants.</p>

<p>The flowers are collected together in
heads, and sometimes are of two kinds
(composite). Using the sunflower for
an example we find a disk of tubular
flowers in the center and, growing
around it, a row of strap-shaped flowers,
while in the dandelion they are all
strap-shaped, and in some other species
all are tubular.</p>

<p>The cineraria is an excellent illustration
of the composite form, which
bears both kinds of flowers.</p>

<p>The name cineraria (Latin, <i>cinerarius</i>,
from <i>cinis</i>, ashes) was given to these
plants because of the grayish down that
covers the surface of the leaves.</p>

<p>The cinerarias form a large genus
of practically herbaceous plants, and
are chiefly natives of southern Africa
and southern and eastern Europe.
The varieties vary greatly from white
to pinkish-purple and through various
shades to dark, bluish-purple.</p>

<p>They are quite easily cultivated, but
are house plants in temperate latitudes.
They are peculiarly liable to
attacks of insects, plant-lice (<i>Aphides</i>)
being especially an enemy.</p>

<p>The florist's varieties are chiefly produced
from the species <i>Cineraria cruenta</i>.
Beautiful hybrids have been developed
from this and other species,
and the flower certainly deserves the
popularity it has attained through sterling
merit.</p>
